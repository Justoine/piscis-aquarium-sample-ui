      <h2>BottleNose Dolphin</h2>
      <p>Bottlenose dolphins can be found all around the world in warm water. They can be found both close to shore in shallow water and far out in deep, dark water. Dolphins have a lot of trouble getting caught in the trash that people dump on the beach.So we have to make sure we don't litter in the ocean.</p>

        <h2>Sea Turtle</h2>
        <p>A long, streamlined shell distinguishes sea turtles. Sea turtles can be olive-green, yellow, greenish-brown, reddish-brown, or black, depending on the species. Swimming limbs and flippers have been developed. Male and female sea turtles are the same size as adults. Sea turtles reproduct from 1-3 years in the beach. Usually when hatching season came, Piscis Aquarium shows them in The Hatch show on every March!</p>

        <h2>Manta-Ray</h2>
        <p>Manta Rays can be found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate oceans all around the world. In Spanish, the word "manta" means "blanket" or "cloak," referring to the animals' huge, flat, diamond-shaped body with triangular pectoral fins. Manta rays are known as "devil fish" because of the two horn-shaped fins that protrude from the front of their heads.</p>

Great hammerhead sharks, unlike scalloped hammerhead sharks, are solitary and migrate alone over distances of up to 756 miles (1,200 km). Great hammerhead sharks also grow at a faster rate than other hammerhead shark species, reaching maturity between the ages of 5 and 9.</p>
